# ECE 4760 Demo Code for the Raspberry Pi Pico
#### [V. Hunter Adams](https://vanhunteradams.com)

This is a collection of RP2040 examples assembled for ECE 4760 at Cornell. ECE 4760 students are asked to clone this repository and add their own lab assignments and projects.

The Lab_1, Lab_2, and Lab_3 folders contain the examples from which I recommend you start for each of your labs. I recommend that you add your own Lab 1, 2, and 3 projects to each of those folders, respectively.
